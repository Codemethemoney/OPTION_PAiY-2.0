# Branching Strategy

This document outlines the branching strategy for the OPTION_PAiY-2.0 project, which integrates an AI IDE (Windsurf/Cursor) with GitHub and StackBlitz.

## Branch Types

### Main Branch

- **Name**: `main`
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Protected from direct pushes
- **Stability**: Always stable and deployable
- **Origin**: The primary branch that all other branches are derived from

The main branch contains the official release history and should always be in a deployable state. Direct commits to this branch are restricted; changes should be incorporated via pull requests from feature branches.

### Feature Branches

- **Naming Format**: `feature-{name}`
- **Purpose**: Development of new features or enhancements
- **Origin**: Created from the main branch
- **Lifespan**: Temporary, deleted after merging to main
- **Example**: `feature-user-authentication`, `feature-dark-mode`

Feature branches are used for developing new features or enhancements. They are created from the main branch and are merged back into main once the feature is complete and has passed all tests.

### Bug Fix Branches

- **Naming Format**: `bugfix-{issue-number}-{short-description}`
- **Purpose**: Fixing bugs or issues
- **Origin**: Created from the main branch
- **Lifespan**: Temporary, deleted after merging to main
- **Example**: `bugfix-123-fix-login-error`

Bug fix branches are used for fixing bugs or issues. They are created from the main branch and are merged back into main once the fix is complete and has passed all tests.

### Hotfix Branches

- **Naming Format**: `hotfix-{version}-{short-description}`
- **Purpose**: Emergency fixes for production issues
- **Origin**: Created from the main branch or a release tag
- **Lifespan**: Temporary, deleted after merging to main
- **Example**: `hotfix-1.0.1-critical-security-fix`

Hotfix branches are used for emergency fixes to production issues. They are created from the main branch or a release tag and are merged back into main once the fix is complete.

### Release Branches

- **Naming Format**: `release-{version}`
- **Purpose**: Preparing for a new release
- **Origin**: Created from the main branch
- **Lifespan**: Temporary, deleted after merging to main
- **Example**: `release-1.0.0`

Release branches are used for preparing a new release. They are created from the main branch and are merged back into main once the release is ready.

## Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop and Test**
   - Make changes to implement the feature
   - Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages
   - Push changes to GitHub to see them in StackBlitz
   - Test the feature thoroughly

3. **Keep Branch Updated**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout feature-name
   git merge main
   git push
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**
   - When the feature is complete, create a pull request on GitHub
   - Assign reviewers to the pull request
   - Address any feedback or issues raised during the review

5. **Merge to Main**
   - Once the pull request is approved, merge it to the main branch
   - Delete the feature branch after merging

6. **Deploy**
   - Deploy the changes to the appropriate environment
   - Monitor for any issues

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Reference issue numbers if applicable
- Keep messages concise but informative

Example:
```
Add user authentication feature (#123)

- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Add login and registration forms
- Set up user profile page
- Add authentication middleware
```

### Branch Management

- Keep branches focused on a single feature or fix
- Regularly update branches with changes from main
- Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean
- Use descriptive branch names that reflect the purpose of the branch

### Code Reviews

- All changes should be reviewed before merging to main
- Reviewers should check for:
  - Code quality and adherence to standards
  - Test coverage
  - Documentation
  - Performance implications
  - Security considerations

### Conflict Resolution

- Resolve conflicts locally before pushing to GitHub
- When conflicts occur:
  1. Pull the latest changes from main
  2. Resolve conflicts in your local environment
  3. Test the resolved code
  4. Push the resolved changes

## GitHub and StackBlitz Integration

The branching strategy is designed to work seamlessly with the GitHub and StackBlitz integration:

- Each branch pushed to GitHub is available in StackBlitz
- Changes can be viewed in real-time in the StackBlitz preview
- Collaborators can work on different branches simultaneously
- Code reviews can be conducted directly in GitHub or StackBlitz

## Automation

The project includes automation to support the branching strategy:

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Automated testing for pull requests
- Branch protection rules for the main branch
- Automated deployment of the main branch to production
