# Future Enhancement Strategies

This document outlines strategies for enhancing the OPTION_PAiY-2.0 project using MCP tools and other approaches.

## MCP Tools for Enhancement

### GitHub Integration

- Use `github.create_branch` for new feature branches:
  ```javascript
  await github.create_branch({
    owner: "Codemethemoney",
    repo: "OPTION_PAiY-2.0",
    branch: "feature-name",
    from_branch: "main"
  });
  ```

- Use `github.create_pull_request` for code reviews:
  ```javascript
  await github.create_pull_request({
    owner: "Codemethemoney",
    repo: "OPTION_PAiY-2.0",
    title: "Feature implementation",
    body: "This PR implements the new feature",
    head: "feature-name",
    base: "main"
  });
  ```

### Automation and Testing

- Use `wcgw.BashCommand` for automated testing and deployment:
  ```javascript
  await wcgw.BashCommand({
    action_json: { 
      command: "cd /path/to/project && npm test && npm run build" 
    },
    wait_for_seconds: null
  });
  ```

### Progress Tracking

- Use `memorymesh.create_note` to track development progress:
  ```javascript
  await memorymesh.create_note({
    title: "Development Milestone",
    content: "Completed implementation of feature X. Next steps: Y and Z."
  });
  ```

### Project Snapshots

- Use `wcgw.ContextSave` for important project milestones:
  ```javascript
  await wcgw.ContextSave({
    id: "milestone-" + Date.now(),
    project_root_path: "/path/to/project",
    description: "Snapshot after implementing feature X",
    relevant_file_globs: ["**/*.*"]
  });
  ```

## Monitoring Strategies

### Continuous Integration

- Implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
  - Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing
  - Set up deployment workflows for staging and production
  - Configure status checks for pull requests

### Error Tracking

- Use Sentry for error tracking:
  - Integrate Sentry SDK into the application
  - Configure error boundaries for React components
  - Set up alerts for critical errors

### Automated Testing

- Set up automated testing with each push:
  - Unit tests with Jest
  - Integration tests with Cypress
  - API tests with Supertest

### Performance Monitoring

- Create dashboard for StackBlitz preview status:
  - Monitor build times
  - Track page load performance
  - Measure API response times

## Performance Optimization

### Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates:
  - Use `npm-check-updates` to identify outdated packages
  - Implement automated dependency updates with Dependabot
  - Review and test dependency changes before merging

### Code Optimization

- Code splitting for faster loading:
  - Implement dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
  - Use React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting
  - Optimize bundle size with webpack bundle analyzer

### Caching Strategies

- Implement caching strategies:
  - Add service workers for offline support
  - Configure HTTP caching headers
  - Implement memory and disk caching for API responses

### Build Process

- Optimize build process:
  - Configure webpack for production builds
  - Implement tree shaking to eliminate unused code
  - Use compression and minification techniques
